## Introduction
The `ENERGY_ANALYSIS` project is dedicated to a computational analysis of the interaction energy between the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the ACE2 receptor, aiming to elucidate the molecular interactions critical for SARS-CoV-2 binding efficacy.

The `Spike RBD-ACE2: Protein-protein interface analysis` project is an academic endeavor by students of the Biophysics course at ESCI-UPF, aimed at providing a computational analysis of the interaction energy between the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the ACE2 receptor.

## Preparation
The `PREVIOUS_REQUIREMENTS` directory contains all the necessary files and information for setting up the computational environment to conduct the analysis.

## Scripts
The `SCRIPTS` directory includes a series of Jupyter notebooks that outline the process of data preparation, analysis, and visualization:
- Step 0: Data preparation and environment setup.
- Step 1: Identification of interface residues.
- Step 2: Computation of interaction energy among protein chains.
- Step 3: Alanine scanning analysis and energy visualization plot.

## Previous Requirements
Ensure that all necessary installations and parameters are in place as specified in the `PREVIOUS_REQUIREMENTS` directory before proceeding with the scripts.

## Report
The `REPORT.pdf` file provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis findings and interpretations. It is a crucial document for understanding the context and results of this project.
